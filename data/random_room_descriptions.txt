The room is dark and dusty, with cobwebs hanging from the ceiling.
The only light comes from a single, flickering candle.
The walls are bare, except for a few old paintings that seem to stare back at you.
The floor is covered in a thick layer of dust, and there are strange symbols drawn in the dust.
There is a foul smell in the air, like something has died.
You can hear strange noises coming from the walls, like whispers or scratching.
There is a feeling of dread in the air, like something is watching you.
You feel like you're not alone in the room, even though you know you are.
The door to the room is locked, and you can't seem to find a way to open it.
You start to feel paranoid, like someone is following you.
You see a shadow move out of the corner of your eye.
You hear a noise behind you, but when you turn around, there's nothing there.
You start to feel dizzy and nauseous.
You see a figure standing in the doorway, but when you look again, it's gone.
You feel like you're being pulled into a dark abyss.
You scream, but no one can hear you.
You wake up in the room, but you're not sure if it was all a dream.
